# **Chat with PDF - Technical Test**

You are required to design a **Chat with PDF** system for interacting with PDF documents. The system should allow users to upload PDF files and interact with the content using AI-powered chat functionality.

## Requirements:

Your system must include the features listed in [Must have](#must-have). You can also implement features in [Nice to have](#nice-to-have) for bonus points.

### **Must have**

1. **PDF Upload**:

   - **Note**: The PDF files may contain images, tables, and code.
2. **AI Chat Functionality**:
   - Allow users to ask questions.
   - Differentiate:
      - **Document-based questions**: Use content from document to generate answer.
      - **General knowledge questions**: Use an external AI API to provide responses unrelated to the document.
3. **Demo Using Streamlit or Gradio** (video or a direct link to the application):
   - Build a simple web-based interface to demonstrate the application.
   - Include PDF upload and chat functionalities in the demo.

### **Nice to have**

- **Multiple Files (PDFs, doc,...)**: Allow users to upload and interact with multiple files simultaneously.
- **Custom UI**: Create a simple custom UI (HTML/CSS/JS or frontend framework) to demo the application.

## Technical requirements

- Language: Python
- Framework: Langchain, Llama-index, CrewAI, AutoGen, Haystack,…
- VectorDatabase: You can use any database you are familiar with such as: Milvus, Qdrant, Chroma, ….

## **How to Submit**

- **Duration**: Complete the task within **3 days**.
- **Submission**: Push your project to a public GitHub repository.
- **Include**:
   - A [**README.md**](http://README.md) file with:
      - Project overview.
      - Setup and installation instructions.
      - How to run the application.
      - How to test the application.
- Send the GitHub repository link via the [submission form](https://vbiacademy.typeform.com/intern)
